#### Satellite-derived spatial GHI with deep learning

The following figure shows an illustration of regional solar irradiance estimations for TBL station using spectral satellite images. (a) The target station and $11\times11$ pixel grid of satellite images for single-station solar irradiance estimation. (b) The target station with 121 surrounding locations and the domain of used spectral satellite images for regional solar irradiance estimation.

The original deep learning model in [2] was developed for ground irradiance estimates at a single location, which is centered in the domain of satellite images with $11\times11$ pixels ((a) in the above figure). The target station can be anywhere as long as there are on-site irradiance measurements available. Following the same methodology, the target is expanded from one station to the $11\times11$ surrounding area with 121 locations ((b) in the above figure). Selected spectral satellite images of GOES-16 with the size of $21\times21$ pixels are used to obtain the GHI estimates for the whole region ($11\times11$ pixels) via the pre-trained deep learning model. For more details on solar irradiance estimation using spectal satellite images and deep learning, please refer to [2].

#### Forecasting methods

The following figure shows the strucuture of deep learning models for GHI forecasting with different inputs.

The end-to-end deep learning model $\mathbb{F}$ can produce multiple CSI forecasts (multiple-output model) with forecast horizons ($\Delta t$) up to 180 minutes (i.e., 15, 30, 45, 60, 90, 120, 150, and 180-minute), which can be formulated as,
```math
\hat{I}_{t_0+15}, \hat{I}_{t_0+30}, ..., \hat{I}_{t_0+180} = \mathbb{F}({\boldsymbol{x}_{t_0}, \boldsymbol{x}_{t_0-5}, ..., \boldsymbol{x}_{t_0-60}})
```
where $\hat{I}$ denotes the CSI forecast, $\boldsymbol{x}$ represents the spatio-temporal spectral satellite measurements.

The hybrid physical-deep learning model is:
```math
\hat{I}_{t_0+15}, \hat{I}_{t_0+30}, ..., \hat{I}_{t_0+180} = \mathbb{F}(\mathbb{P}({\boldsymbol{x}_{t_0}, \boldsymbol{x}_{t_0-5}, ..., \boldsymbol{x}_{t_0-60}})),
```
where $\mathbb{P}$ is the physical model used to convert spectral satellite measurements $\boldsymbol{x}$ to spatial GHI estimations of NSRDB.

The deep learning model chain is then formulated as:
```math
\hat{I}_{t_0+15}, \hat{I}_{t_0+30}, ..., \hat{I}_{t_0+180} = \mathbb{F}(\mathbb{E}({\boldsymbol{x}_{t_0}, \boldsymbol{x}_{t_0-5}, ..., \boldsymbol{x}_{t_0-60}})),
```
where $\mathbb{E}$ is the deep learning model to derive spatial GHI estimates of SAT-DL from spectral satellite measurements $\boldsymbol{x}$.

The deep learning model using satellite-derived spatial GHI estimates (with a pre-trained deep learning model) thus forms a deep learning model chain, the notebook is available [here](https://github.com/sl-chen/Solar-forecasting-with-deep-learning-model-chain/blob/main/ghi_forecasting_bon_sat-dl-3h.ipynb).

Note that the examples made here are only for the BON station. However, the results for other stations follows the same methods and procedure.
